# Event Detection using AST (Audio Spectrogram Transformer)

This repository contains the code for the event detection task in the Kaggle competition [ITMO Acoustic Event Detection 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/itmo-acoustic-event-detection-2023). The goal of the competition is to detect specific events in audio data using the AST (Audio Spectrogram Transformer) model.

## Usage

To use the notebook `transformer-based.ipynb` in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Log in to Kaggle and go to the [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks) page.
2. Go to the Kaggle competition page [ITMO Acoustic Event Detection 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/itmo-acoustic-event-detection-2023) and join the competition.
3. Click on "New Notebook" and choose the "Notebook" option.
4. Select the "File" tab and click on "Upload Notebook".
5. Choose the `transformer-based.ipynb` file from your local machine and upload it to Kaggle.
6. After the notebook is uploaded, you can open and run it on the Kaggle platform.

Note: The necessary dataset files should be provided by the competition organizers, and you need to make sure to place them in the appropriate location within the Kaggle environment.
